FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification. For the details, please see [FinBERT: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063).

The model will give softmax outputs for three labels: positive, negative or neutral.
